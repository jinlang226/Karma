Verifies the agent set the configured cluster setting to the configured value and
that it persists across a pod restart. Both the setting name and the target value
come from the case params (BENCH_PARAM_SETTING_NAME / BENCH_PARAM_SETTING_VALUE),
so the same oracle works for every setting the workflows exercise (byte rates,
