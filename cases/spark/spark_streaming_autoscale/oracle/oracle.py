"""Oracle for spark/spark_streaming_autoscale.

Verifies the operator actively scaled the cluster through the traffic phases:
  - the Spark cluster is up (master ready, >= 1 worker),
  - spark-worker was scaled through the prompt's phase targets (up to the
    Phase-3 peak of 20, via the Phase-2 step of 10, then back to the baseline
    of 5), graded from the DURABLE scale history the resource records itself
    (the deployment controller's ScalingReplicaSet events + the live spec),
    corroborated by the metrics-server watch log, and
  - the traffic generator is running or has completed.

O46: the scale outcome is graded from the deployment's own recorded history,
not solely from a fixed-interval helper-pod watch log — that lossy sampler
misses transitions under adversary pod-churn, zeroing a flawless agent.
