"""Guard against the always-pass precondition probe anti-pattern.

A precondition probe signals "is the target state already present?" via its
exit code: exit 0 -> present (skip apply), non-zero -> absent (run apply).
A probe that can never fail (e.g. ending in ``|| true``) makes the harness
believe the scenario is always already set up, so the apply that deploys the
workload is silently skipped. A port once did exactly this to 57 cases
(``kubectl get pods | grep -c Running || true``), leaving every StatefulSet
case undeployed. This test keeps that from recurring.
