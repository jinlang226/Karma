"""
Single-stage lifecycle execution.

:func:`run_stage` is the innermost execution unit called by
``runtime.workflow`` for each stage in the workflow loop.

Stage execution steps:

1. Create the stage directory via ``protocol``.
2. Launch the kubectl proxy via ``transport.k8s.backend``.
3. Bind namespace roles and create namespaces via the environment provider.
4. Run precondition units.
5. Plant decoys.
6. Run adversary deploy units.
7. Write the agent credential bundle (kubeconfig, env vars).
8. Render and write the stage prompt.
9. Launch the agent via ``sandbox``.
10. Poll for ``submit.txt`` or wait for the agent timeout.
11. Terminate the agent process.
12. Collect evidence via ``evidence``.
13. Run the oracle via ``oracle``.
14. Run adversary lift units.
15. Write stage metadata and outcome.
16. Tear down the proxy and clean up namespaces.

:func:`run_stage` never raises. All errors are captured in the returned
stage result dict under the ``"error"`` key so that ``runtime.workflow``
can decide whether to retry or advance.

    detection or legacy field handling is performed here; the legacy
    execution branch from ``run_flow.py`` is not carried forward.

    For each unit, the probe tests whether the target state already holds:

    * probe **passes** -> state already present, apply is skipped.
    * probe **fails** + ``on_probe_fail="skip"`` (the default, used by setup
      units) -> the "not yet present" signal is expected, so apply runs to
      establish the state, then verify.
    * probe **fails** + ``on_probe_fail="error"`` -> a readiness/convergence
      gate the apply cannot satisfy. The probe is retried up to
      ``verify_retries`` times (``verify_interval_sec`` apart) to let a slow
      cluster converge; the failure becomes fatal only after that budget.

    Retries verify up to ``verify_retries`` times with
    ``verify_interval_sec`` between attempts. All command output is
    appended to *log_path*.

    ``phase_timeout_sec`` bounds the wall-clock time of the whole phase
