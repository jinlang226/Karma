"""
Workflow loop, stage advance, state publication, and final sweeps.

:func:`run_workflow_loop` is the outermost execution loop. It iterates
over workflow rows, calls ``runtime.case.run_stage`` for each stage,
manages retries and fail-fast decisions, publishes workflow state after
each stage, and runs final sweeps on completion.

Final sweeps:

*Regression sweep*
    Re-runs the oracle for all completed stages to detect regressions
    introduced by later stages. By default (``final_sweep_mode="auto"``)
    executed only when the workflow completes successfully with more than
    one stage; ``"off"`` disables it and ``"full"`` sweeps whenever at
    least one stage passed.

*Adversary cleanup sweep*
    Lifts any adversary injections whose ``lift_at_stage`` never ran due
    to an early workflow exit, ensuring no adversarial conditions are left
    in the cluster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rows:
        Ordered workflow row list from

    run_id:
        Unique identifier for this run.

        Root directory for all run artifacts.
    resources_dir:
        Root resources directory forwarded to ``run_stage``.

        Agent launch metadata from ``agents.registry.resolve_agent``.
    sandbox_mode:
        ``"local"`` or ``"docker"``.
    environment:
        Initialized environment provider from ``environments.registry``.
    prompt_mode:
        One of the prompt modes defined in ``definitions.prompts``.
    on_stage_complete:
        Optional callable invoked with the stage result dict after each
        stage (including retries). Used by the HTTP SSE path to push
        progress events to the UI.
    stage_failure_mode:
        ``"terminate"`` (default) stops the workflow at the first stage that
        does not pass (fail-fast). ``"continue"`` runs the remaining stages
        anyway; the overall status is still ``"failed"``.
    final_sweep_mode:
        Controls the final regression sweep. ``"auto"`` (default) sweeps when
        the workflow completed with more than one passed stage; ``"off"``
        never sweeps; ``"full"`` sweeps whenever at least one stage passed
